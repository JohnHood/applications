SYNOPSIS

    /share/apps/OpenBUGS-3.2.2/bin/OpenBUGS [options] [args]

EXAMPLES

	OpenBUGS

    OpenBUGS script.txt

    OpenBUGS script.txt > res.lst

    OpenBUGS < script.txt >res.lst

    OpenBUGS -t script.txt

    env BUGSIN="/dif/dir" BUGSOUT="/other/dir" OpenBUGS script.txt > /path/to/res.lst

DESCRIPTION

	Invoke OpenBUGS, usually specifying a script and performing template
    expansion inside the script file to specifiy directory paths.


    Names inside of curly brackets in a script file are interpreted 
    as environmental variables and the values of the environmental 
    variables are substituted.  The environmental variables can be 
    set temporarily on the same command line as OpenBUGS execution 
    using the env function, or on a separate line or in a default 
    startup file.

        
    Note: the OpenBUGS script command 'modelSetWD('path')' can now be
    used as an easier way to set the path where OpenBUGS looks for
    model, data and initial value files.  The environment variable
    mechanism is still available however, for backward compatibility.


OPTIONS

    -d
       Dry run.  Script will be printed on stdout. 

    -b 
        Specify the number of curly brackets used to delimit template
        names.  

    -h

        help

    -t 

        do not perform template expansion


    --   end of options
